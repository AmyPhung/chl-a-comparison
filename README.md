# Chlorophyll-a Comparison
Contains jupyter notebooks to create figures for a paper titled "A Comparison of Biogeochemical Argo Sensors, Remote Sensing Systems, and Shipborne Field Fluorometers to Measure Chlorophyll a Concentrations in the Pacific Ocean off the Northern Coast of New Zealand"

Original code (in archive folder and in `Extended Abstract Figures.ipynb`) was written during my time with SEA Semester on board the SSV *Robert C. Seamans* and was used for the original extended abstract submission. For the final paper, some code was rewritten and the figures in the `Revised Figures` notebooks were used.
